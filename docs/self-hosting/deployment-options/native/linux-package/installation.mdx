---

Infisical can be deployed on Linux virtual machines without containers using our Linux packages. Currently, we support Linux systems running on AMD64 architecture (ARM coming soon).

This standalone deployment uses a "Bring Your Own Database" (BYOD) approach, meaning you'll need to provide your own PostgreSQL and Redis databases for Infisical services. These databases are not included in the package.

## Prerequisites

Before beginning the installation, ensure you have:

- A server running a linux-based operating system (Ubuntu, Debian) or RHEL-based system
- A PostgreSQL database instance
- A Redis database instance

## Installation Steps

<Steps>
<Step title="Install the Infisical Package">
Choose your operating system below to install Infisical:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Debian/Ubuntu">
    First, add the Infisical repository:
    ```bash
    curl -1sLf \
    'https://dl.cloudsmith.io/public/infisical/infisical-core/setup.deb.sh' \
    | sudo -E bash
    ```

    Then install Infisical:
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y infisical-core
    ```

    > **Note**: For production environments, we strongly recommend installing a specific version of the package to maintain consistency across reinstalls. View available versions at [Infisical Package Versions](https://cloudsmith.io/~infisical/repos/infisical-core/packages/).

  </Tab>

  <Tab title="RedHat/CentOS/Amazon Linux">
    First, add the Infisical repository:
    ```bash
    curl -1sLf \
    'https://dl.cloudsmith.io/public/infisical/infisical-core/setup.rpm.sh' \
    | sudo -E bash
    ```

    Then install Infisical:
    ```bash
    sudo yum install infisical-core
    ```

    > **Note**: For production environments, we strongly recommend installing a specific version of the package to maintain consistency across reinstalls. View available versions at [Infisical Package Versions](https://cloudsmith.io/~infisical/repos/infisical-core/packages/).

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

To verify the installation, run:

```bash
infisical-ctl help
```

</Step>
<Step title="Create the Configuration File">
Create an `infisical.rb` file in the `/etc/infisical` directory. This file will contain your database connections and other configuration settings.

<Accordion title="Example Configuration">
```ruby
# Important: Replace these values with secure keys in production
infisical_core['ENCRYPTION_KEY'] = '6c1fe4e407b8911c104518103505b218'
infisical_core['AUTH_SECRET'] = '5lrMXKKWCVocS/uerPsl7V+TX/aaUaI7iDkgl3tSmLE='

# Database connection strings
infisical_core['DB_CONNECTION_URI'] = 'postgres://infisical:infisical@localhost:5432/infisical'
infisical_core['REDIS_URL'] = 'redis://localhost:6379'
```
</Accordion>

For a complete list of configuration options, visit our [configuration variables documentation](/self-hosting/configuration/envars).

</Step>
<Step title="Start Infisical">
1. Run the following command to start the Infisical server:
   ```bash
   infisical-ctl reconfigure
   ```
   By default, the server will run on port `8080`. You can modify this in the `infisical.rb` configuration file.

2. Monitor your deployment:
   - Check the application status:
     ```bash
     infisical-ctl status
     ```
   - View real-time logs:
     ```bash
     infisical-ctl tail
     ```
</Step>
