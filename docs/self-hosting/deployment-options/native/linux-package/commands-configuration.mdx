## Configuration

All Infisical configuration is managed from a central file called `infisical.rb` located in the `/etc/infisical` directory.

<Info> After updating the `infisical.rb` file, remember to run `infisical-ctl reconfigure` to apply the changes. </Info>

### Example Configuration

```ruby
# Important: Replace these values with secure keys in production
infisical_core['ENCRYPTION_KEY'] = '6c1fe4e407b8911c104518103505b218'
infisical_core['AUTH_SECRET'] = '5lrMXKKWCVocS/uerPsl7V+TX/aaUaI7iDkgl3tSmLE='

# Database connection strings
infisical_core['DB_CONNECTION_URI'] = 'postgres://infisical:infisical@localhost:5432/infisical'
infisical_core['REDIS_URL'] = 'redis://localhost:6379'
```
